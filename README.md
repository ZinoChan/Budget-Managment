## Overview

Welcome to the Budget API! This project aims to provide a robust and flexible API for users to create and manage their personal budgets using the principles of Envelope Budgeting. Envelope Budgeting is a method where users allocate specific amounts of money to different spending categories or "envelopes," helping them manage their finances effectively.

## Features

- **Envelope Management:** Users can create, update, and delete budget envelopes to organize their spending categories.
- **Balance Tracking:** The API allows users to track the balance of each envelope, ensuring they stay within their allocated budget.
- **RESTful Design:** Adheres to best practices for REST API design, including proper endpoint naming conventions and response codes.
- **Data Validation:** Implements robust data validation to prevent users from overspending and to ensure the integrity of budget data.
